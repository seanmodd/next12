ShopCarX.com is a web application that allows users to search for and purchase used AND new cars. 
The organization of the directory sucks and needs to constantly be updated. Sorry for that, I suck - Sean Modd.

<details open>
<summary><b>Inventory of Vehicles</b></summary>
<br />


The **ShopCarX** inventory is being scraped on a daily basis from the following dealerships:

- [Stevens Creek Chrysler Jeep Dodge](https://www.stevenscreekchryslerjeepdodge.net/)
- [Stevens Creek Kia](https://www.stevenscreekkia.com/)
- [Fremont Mazda](http://fremontmazda.com/)
- [Serramonte Subaru](https://www.serramontesubaru.com/)
- [Serramonte Volkswagen](https://www.serramontevw.com/)
- [Hayward Volkswagen](https://www.vwhayward.com/)
- [Hayward Nissan](http://www.haywardnissan.com/)
- [Stoneridge Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram](https://www.stoneridgechryslerjeepdodgeofdublin.com/)
- [Sunnyvale Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram](https://www.sunnyvalecdjr.com/)

The **ShopCarX** scraper is not linked here as Sean is actively working on it himself at the moment, contact him for more information.
The scraper is still under development, right now the vehicles are just showing dummy inventory data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
<details open>
<summary><b>Installation Details</b></summary>
<br />

- Clone [server from the repo here](https://github.com/seanmodd/jamstack-final-backend/).
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/seanmodd/jamstack-final-backend.git
   ```
- Once you have cloned it locally, run <code>npm install</code> to install all the dependencies.
- Now run <code>npm run develop</code> to start the server, now the server should be live on localhost:1337!

<b>2. Start the **ShopCarX** frontend:</b>
- Clone this github repo to your local machine.
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/seanmodd/cleaningNext.git
   ```
- Once you have cloned it locally, ***you don't need to access branch vSean unlike the next12 repo!!*** 
- Great, now you run <code>yarn install</code> to install all the dependencies.
- Now run <code>yarn run start</code> and you can visit the web app now live on localhost:3000!

<!-- GraphQl -->
## GraphQl

#### Explained: How GraphQl is being used with Redux for Server-Side Rendering
<summary>Overview of the GraphQl Queries occuring on page <code>/dashboard/shop</code>, <code>/dashboard/shop/[makeName]</code> and <code>/dashboard/[makeName]/[id]</code> which <b>server-side render</b> all cars from the Strapi GraphQl API</summary>
<br />


<details open>
<summary><b>How the GraphQl Queries Are Being Called?</b></summary>
<br />


The GraphQl Queries are being both **server-side rendered** while being dispatched via **redux toolkit** in the following approach:

- To see a sample of it occurring, please visit the page <code>/dashboard/shop/index</code>
- You will notice two critical redux-related imports: <code>import { getProducts, filterProducts } from 'src/___redux/slices/product';</code> and <code>import { wrapperStore } from 'src/___redux/store.js';</code>
  - The redux is being server-side rendered due to the wrapperstore which is imported from <code>import { wrapperStore } from 'src/___redux/store.js';</code> and is not as relevant in this instance
  - More relevant: the getProducts and filterProducts being imported from <code>import { getProducts, filterProducts } from 'src/___redux/slices/product';</code> 
- Open the file from <code>import { getProducts, filterProducts } from 'src/___redux/slices/product';</code>
- In order to see the GraphQl query, go to the getProducts dispatch and you will see how the GraphQl queries are being made!
  - You'll notice a lot of them are just junk queries and not currently being utilized, we should clean this up definitely but for now it's just there for reference I guess... sorry I suck

<details open>
<summary><b>How to Test the GraphQl Queries?</b></summary>
<br />


The GraphQl Queries can be made through a playground I have created on **Apollo Studio**, follow the steps below to test it:

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VmonacB.jpeg" width="350px">

- Go to the shared playground I have created [here in Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/ShopCarX-Pavan/explorer?explorerURLState=N4IgJg9gxgrgtgUwHYBcQC4QEcYIE4CeABAGoCGeAlmagM4CyZA1ggBQAkA7gBb4LpEAUgGUA8gDkAlEWAAdJESIA3CtTqsefAV154E0uQsVEAxMtU0UtGfONFKYW8awoCTxWagQANhDzvTIlpKAC8EANpXb3CjRQAHKigYuygKAH0kMkQA1Lw0uGYEDKzk4wSIMBgoFBtY4wcAxUzsusVUlAQAcz9iQzs7BtbjZtL%2BojAEWigqOJRKCCRGogBfeVWjdfWQABoQFSoyACNo2gwQPqJZEE09K4ELxSvyyuq72rGrkbSvVDJKJFobyuUG4hFo0X8IAC60UmxAyyAA&variant=current)
  - You may have to create your own free Apollo Studio account to test the GraphQl queries, please go ahead and do so!
- Now you may run sample GraphQl queries, or even the very same ones I have made and dispatched from within <code>'src/___redux/slices/product'</code>

<!-- Todo -->
## Todo

#### MOST IMPORTANT ACTION ITEM:
<summary><b>Showing All Likes On User Dashboard</b></summary>

- [ ] Create an option to like a vehicle
  - [ ] Create an option to like a car from the shop page at <code>/dashboard/shop/</code>
  - [ ] Create an option to like a car from each car's page within the dynamically generated single car page at <code>/dashboard/shop/[makeName]/[id]</code>
  - [ ] If user is not logged in when they click heart, then show a "login" button to login to their account

- [ ] Reflect all liked vehicles from the user dashboard which already exists
  - [ ] Here is the UI of <code>/dashboard/app/account</code> aka the current template: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SeCJfs6.jpeg" alt="Logo" width="200px">
  - [ ] Create a dashboard from user's home profile page with all the cars they have liked
  - [ ] If user has liked a car, then show a "liked" button or "heart" that is already filled in
 
  
#### SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ACTION ITEM:
<summary><b>Create Visitor Popup to Retrieve Emails</b></summary>

- [ ] For visitors who have been on website for over 5 seconds as guest, create a dialog popup to retrieve email for new announcements and more


#### THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ACTION ITEM:
<summary><b>Carfax Price Estimator</b></summary>

- [ ] Complete the carfax price estimator page on <code>/dashboard/carfax-value</code> with the 3 approaches to find out your car's value immediately
  - [ ] Before we show the price of the vehicle, request for mobile number or email address and we must store that data internally and get notified of it internally!
  - [x] Make and model carfax esitmator must be created on <code>/dashboard/carfax-value</code> and after submitting valid data, redirects to <code>/dashboard/carfax-value/make</code>...
  - [x] VIN carfax estimator must be created on <code>/dashboard/carfax-value</code> and after submitting valid data, redirects to <code>/dashboard/carfax-value/vin</code>...
  - [ ] License Plate and state estimator must be created on <code>/dashboard/carfax-value</code> and after submitting valid data, redirects to <code>/dashboard/carfax-value/vin</code>... <b>this is because the license plate and state data points retrieve the VIN and then the VIN is used to retrieve the vehicle so we're back to the same approach utilized in the VIN estimator</b>



#### ALL OTHER ACTION ITEMS:
<summary><b>Create the Inbox Page for Users Who Have Signed In</b></summary>

- [ ] On <code>/dashboard/mail/all</code> complete the look and functionality to allow users to send messages back and forth with Admin (us)

<summary><b>Finish the Vehicle Search Capability</b></summary>

- [ ] Create a search capability utilizing the search bar component which is already created

<summary><b>Automatically Request for Zip Code Access</b></summary>

- [ ] Ask for location access in the app in order to get the zip code
